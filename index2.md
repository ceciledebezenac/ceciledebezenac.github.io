[About me](about.md) 

## Biography
As part of the 2019 cohort of the CDT in Data Analytics and Scociety, I am a first year doctoral student based in both
Leeds and the Alan Turing Institute. After my degree in engineering in l'Ecole Centrale Paris where I specialised in 
civil engineering and urban planning, I felt compelled to dive back into academics to more thoroughly analyse the underlying 
processes at play in urban construction. I went on to study demography and statistics in Aix Marseille Universit√© before
exploring urban modelling techniques in LIDA. 

## Research interests
I am interested in identifying and modelling the social dynamics that make up the foundation of what is today defined as a city. In particular, my research will focus on bottom-up modelling approaches using agent based simulations in hopes of refining their depiction of existing structures and their prediction of possible outcomes. 

## Projects
I have been able to participate in various projects dealing with urban planning and governance, each one representing different interests and some of the many stances stakeholders adopt in regards to the construction of a city. For more information visit [my projects](projects.md) 
 
- Redefining a social housing scheme for an intermediate social class in the Paris region. 
- Designing efficient strategies for the furture development of the Seine valley.
- ABM model to predict general practitioner mobility in France. 
- Multiscale approach to identify complex patterns of spatial segregation.
