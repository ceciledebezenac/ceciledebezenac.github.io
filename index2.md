## Biography
As part of the 2019 cohort of the CDT in Data Analytics and Scociety, I am a first year doctoral student based in both
Leeds and the Alan Turing Institute. After my degree in engineering in l'Ecole Centrale Paris where I specialised in 
civil engineering and urban planning, I felt compelled to dive back into academics to more thoroughly analyse the underlying 
processes at play in urban construction. I went on to study demography and statistics in Aix Marseille Université before
exploring urban modelling techniques in LIDA.
