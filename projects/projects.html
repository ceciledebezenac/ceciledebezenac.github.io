        		<h1>Projects</h1>
				<p>I have been able to participate in various projects dealing with urban planning and governance, 
        each one representing different interests and some of the many stances stakeholders adopt in regards
        to the construction of a city. </p>

		        <h2>Social Housing Scheme in the Paris region</h2>
				<p>Inâ€™li is an intermediate housing firm, that develops, 
        builds and manages properties in the Paris region. With over 32 000 housing units in the area, 
        efficiently valuing existing property has become a major solution for further development 
        so as to progressively shift the brand image in new directions and address an entirely new market. 
        During my 6 month internship, I developed corporate tools to efficiently analyse inli patrimony, 
        identify valuation potential in regards to the general strategy and set up an adequate financial plan and construction program. 
        My Master dissertation was based on this experience and this particular mission.</p>
			
      <h2>Designing for landscapes in the Vallee de la Seine: urban planning award 2017</h2>
					<p>I participated in an interdisciplinary urban design project, along with architects, urban planners, economists and sociologists. 
          We were interested in rethinking the development and the management of the territory Vallee de la Seine, stretching out from the heart of Paris to the coasts of Normandy. 
          This diverse area has received some attention as rail and road infrastructure projects are being designed in line with the idea of an ever extending capital region. 
          We suggested a sustainable strategy that takes into account 
          the uncertainties associated with developing projects and the specificities of the triptych river landscape: 
          rural, periurban and urban. This project won first prize 2017 (<a href="https://ergapolis.org/formation/le-concours-ergapolis/">ergapolis</a>).</p>
		 
     <h2>Agent Based modelling: grazing sheep</h2>
		<p>
		As part of my CDT program in LIDA,
		I have designed an agent-based model that simulates grazing sheep.
			
		For more information on the project, please refer to the this <a href="https://ceciledebezenac.github.io/abm/">page</a>.
		The source code is accessible on my <a href="https://github.com/ceciledebezenac/abm">Github</a>.

      <h2>Multi-scale segregation measures: the distortion index</h2>
		<p>
		Residential ethnic segregation measures used are very often dependant on the 
		arbitrary scale used by the administration for census collection. However this may lead to bias when analysing the demographic specificities of each unit.
		As part of my Masters project, I participated in developing a multi scale method of measurment based on KL divergence profiles. 
		For the Assignment 2, I have coded a Python module, segregation_index for wider use and reproductibility considerations: <a href="https://github.com/ceciledebezenac/segregation_index/README.md">page</a> 
		
		Please check out my GitHub page where the source code is available for download or installation using the url <a href="https://github.com/ceciledebezenac/segregation_index">Github</a> 
		For a detailed example and application of this module, go through the Chicago example here: <a href="https://github.com/ceciledebezenac/segregation_index/example_distortion.html">Example</a>
		The data is not yet available on my GitHub due to technical issues.
